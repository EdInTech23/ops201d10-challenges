ops201d10- Ops challenges!


This is a repo dedicated to my challenges during my time in Code Fellows ops-201 journey. It includes shell scripts in bash batch and windows/linux command lines. This was a big step to get into cybersecurity i still have alot to learn but i know i am getting closer and more expirenced becuase of the challenges in shell scripting. I still have alot to improve and i know with time and more expirence in the IT field it will be easy to learn.
